# rosetta-swadesh-lists

Mirror of the Rosetta Project Swadesh Lists, preserved on Internet Archive.

I have decided to mirror this to Github for ease of use for other people.

## Excluded

Files that do not follow the `rosettaproject_{code}_swadesh-{digit}` naming convention.

## Notes

`eng.txt` appears to have been manually edited on Internet Archive, as it does not follow the typical formatting. If you are automating something with this dataset, pay special attention to it.

The archival script is attached in `/script`, in case anyone is interested.

## Sources

Gathered using [this Internet Archive search](http://archive.org/search.php?query=swadesh%20collection:rosettaproject).

For more information, see [Rosetta Project](http://www.rosettaproject.org/archive/collection).

## License

According to Internet Archive, such as [here](https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_hun_swadesh-1), these lists are licensed under CC-BY-3.0. It is possible that not every single one is, but that would require a more complicated search.
